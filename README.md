  Project -  A program that allows a person to play tic-tac-toe
 against the computer(if you don't know tic-tac-toe, see game rules below).
<br>
 The Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
<br>
  1) The game board is a three by three square grid of symbols, which is initially empty.
   The squares are numbered as in the above image.
  2) There are two players, named Player X and Player O. Player O goes first.
  3) A player moves by selecting an empty square on the board.
  4) A symbol representing that player (i.e., an X or an O) is placed on the selected square,
   and it becomes the other player's turn.
  5) The game is won if one player gets three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
  6) The game is a draw if all the squares become occupied; yet no player has won.
